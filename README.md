 ## Preamble Detection ## 

  The goal of the project is to create an algorithm that finds the location and the length of the preamble of the OFDM burst by using a signal dataset from GPU through bash with Python3.

  The automatization algorithm has been developing to find the length and the location of the preamble to feed the complex valued Convolutional Neural Network specifically designed by WCSL group for RF fingerprinting.
  
  The language is python and Object Oriented principles like inheritance had been followed while implementing the algorithm.
