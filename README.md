 ## Preamble Detection ## 

  The goal of the project is to create an algorithm that finds the location and the length of the preamble of the OFDM burst by using a signal dataset from GPU through bash with Python3.

  The automatization algorithm had been developed to find the length and the location of the preamble(a known squence in a vector) which is a feature of the complex valued Convolutional Neural Network specifically designed by WCSL group for RF fingerprinting.
  
  The language is python and Object Oriented principles like inheritance had been followed while implementing the algorithm.
  
  In this project, cosine similarity, PCA and correlation were implemented to create the algorithm and the extracted data which has been fed into a CNN architecture for testing purposes.
